This is a regular paragraph.\
with a second line soft  line break (two spaces)
This is next line.

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but....
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
